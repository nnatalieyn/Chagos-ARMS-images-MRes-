# Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structure (ARMS) Image Analysis Scripts
This repository contains R scripts used in a Masters of Research (MRes) thesis at Imperial College London, August 2025.
Running the full script with the data (not available publicly) will allow for full replications of the maps, plots and statistical outputs in the thesis.

**Project title:** Spatiotemporal patterns in Indo-Pacific reef cryptobenthic communities using image analysis and computer vision
